# Description:
We are creating a collaborative storytelling website. In this, users will be allowed to sign up and log in. The next page brings them to a storyboard page where it displays all the stories they've already added to. There will be an option to create a new story or add to an existing one. Upon selecting an option, the user be brought to another page where they can browse stories or create a new one. Adding to a story entails users being only able to view the most recent submission, having the option to add text and images, and only being able to add exactly once.
